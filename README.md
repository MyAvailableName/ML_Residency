Files description:
-  In the "Anaerobic Threshold" directory, there are scripts for data analysis and model training aimed at estimating a person's anaerobic threshold from the first minutes of the test.
The purpose of these works were to get an anaerobic threshold with machine learning methods based on medical dataset of sportsmen's anaerobic threshold.
The future realisation would be able to predict anaerobic threshold for pacients with hard diseases, who can't pass the whole test by traditional ways.
- preprocess_bacillus - also a part of educational practice at the computer science department in SPbGETU "LETI". It is a preparatory code to convert .mat files to .tiff,
cause the structure of bacillus images was given by 3 dimensionals. Next step was separating the image by mask of bacillus (on one plate were several types of bacillus).
The future gole of project is to apply NN in order to characterize some bacillus by camera without difficult laboratory researches with mycroscope.
- two HW's files are educational scripts from ML course in HSE. Beside data analysis they include some ML methods such as Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso), Logistic Regression, SVM.
